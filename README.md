 My SAP ABAP mini projects and code snippets.

Project name: Creation of ALV using REUSE_ALV_LIST_DISPLAY.

Description: This project demonstrates the development of an ALV (ABAP List Viewer) List Display in SAP, designed to retrieve and display sales document data dynamically based on user input.

Key Features:
User Input: The program prompts the user to enter a sales document number.

Data Retrieval: It fetches relevant records from two important SAP tables:

VBAK: Sales Document: Header Data

VBAP: Sales Document: Item Data

ALV Display: The retrieved data is displayed in a clean, interactive ALV grid format, allowing users to easily view and analyze the sales document details.

Dynamic Selection: The ALV list updates based on the sales document number specified by the user, ensuring focused and relevant data presentation.

Purpose:
This project serves as a practical example of how to use ABAP programming to integrate user input, database retrieval, and ALV reporting in SAP. 

Technologies used (SAP ABAP):

1. ABAP (Advanced Business Application Programming): The primary programming language used to develop the logic for data retrieval and ALV list display.

2. SAP NetWeaver Application Server: The platform where the ABAP program is executed and integrated with SAP modules.

3. ALV (ABAP List Viewer) Grid Control: A standard SAP tool used to display tabular data in an interactive and user-friendly format.

4. SAP Tables VBAK and VBAP: Standard SAP database tables used to fetch sales document header and item data respectively.

5. SAP GUI (Graphical User Interface): The interface through which users interact with the ABAP program and input the sales document number.
